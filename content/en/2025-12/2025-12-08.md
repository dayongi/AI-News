### Product & Feature Updates

1.  **arXiv's website just dropped an HTML version for paper display!** This cool update, which kicked off experimentally in 2023, leverages [LaTeXML technology](https://newshacker.me/story?id=46173825) to convert TeX files into semantic web pages. Why's that awesome? Well, these semantic tags make everything super accessible for screen readers, zooming, and [browser translation extensions](https://newshacker.me/story?id=46173825), significantly improving the user experience. While PDFs aren't going anywhere anytime soon, community projects like [ar5iv](https://newshacker.me/story?id=46173825) are already offering alternative rendering. Plus, mathematical formulas get that sweet, precise typesetting thanks to [MathML/SVG](https://newshacker.me/story?id=46173825). (AI News)

2.  **The Dǒubāo phone, co-developed by Dǒuyīn (TikTok's Chinese version) and manufactured by Nubia, just got hit with a platform ban!** 🚫 This device was a hot topic 🔥 for its ability to perform complex tasks like "Fight the Landlord" with a single voice command. However, it seems to have stepped on some toes, specifically [Dǒuyīn and other tech giants' interests](https://m.okjike.com/originalPosts/6934f060a7fda7e20bae6cf2), leading to emergency adjustments for several features. Dǒuyīn even released an announcement, advocating for co-creating industry standards and [protecting all parties' rights](https://m.okjike.com/originalPosts/6934f060a7fda7e20bae6cf2). Good news for fans though: a second-generation product is expected to drop in 2026! ✨ (AI News Daily)

### Frontier Research

1.  **Qùwán and Peking University just dropped the ETrajEval framework, a blazing-hot new evaluation tool for emotional trajectories!** 🔥 This [ETrajEval framework](https://www.jiqizhixin.com/articles/2025-12-07-3) uses Markov processes to simulate long-term conversations, dynamically sniffing out a model's emotional support capabilities. They built out 328 scenarios and 1152 interference events, introducing three key metrics: BEL, ETV, and ECP. Get this: Grok-4.20 actually outperformed models like DeepSeek in English conversations, and the [paper was even accepted by AAAI-2026](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09003v1)! (AI News)

2.  **Cornell University has unveiled a slick new GAN-like training method called PasoDoble!** This framework pits two models, a Proposer and a Solver, against each other in adversarial training. The Proposer cooks up challenging problems and gets rewards for difficulty, while the Solver earns feedback for correct solutions. Get this: [under unsupervised training](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.10395), Qwen3-1.7B's accuracy on MATH-500 shot up from a decent 45% to an impressive 67%! By leveraging MegaMath pre-training data and employing the GRPO algorithm, they've ensured rock-solid offline training stability. The [project homepage is already publicly available](https://hcy123902.github.io/PasoDoble/) for you to check out. (AI News)

3.  **Google has just dropped a game-changing guide for AI multi-agent context management!** 🚀 They've proposed a hierarchical architecture that splits context into four neat parts: [work layer, session, memory, and artifacts](https://x.com/shao__meng/status/1997453141147881743). This smart approach is all about avoiding token bloat and skyrocketing costs. By using a pipelined processor chain and on-demand loading, they're nailing precise recall and low-latency responses. Plus, the [ADK framework](https://x.com/omarsar0/status/1997642789425660361) introduces a narrative transition mechanism to keep agents from getting confused. It's totally applicable to ecosystems like Claude or OpenAI. (AI News Daily)

### Industry Outlook & Social Impact

1.  **CMU just dropped a bombshell: AI-generated code is riddled with serious vulnerabilities!** 🔥 The [SUSVIBES benchmark test](https://x.com/shao__meng/status/1997453141147881743) revealed that while Claude-4-Sonnet achieved a 61% functional pass rate, only a measly 10.5% of that code was actually secure. Over 80% of the generated code contained [critical vulnerabilities](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.03262) like SQL injection and timing side-channels. And here's the kicker: security prompts weren't just ineffective; they actually *reduced* the functional pass rate by 6%! Yikes! 😬 (AI News Daily)

2.  **The UK railway system actually halted trains because of AI-fabricated images!** 🚫 Fake photos of a collapsed bridge, circulating on social media after an earthquake, prompted [Network Rail to dispatch personnel for on-site verification](https://newshacker.me/story?id=46178108), only to confirm no damage. This whole incident highlights the scary risk of high-frequency false alarms from cheap AI fakes. It's sparked calls to update emergency procedures and to start [introducing sensors like LIDAR](https://newshacker.me/story?id=46178108). Experts are also suggesting a combined approach with local news and legal mechanisms to tackle this head-on. (AI News Daily)

3.  **Grok-4.20 just totally crushed it in the Alpha Arena, bagging the stock trading championship!** 🏆 During a two-week live U.S. stock trading simulation, Grok raked in a sweet 12.11% return by grabbing [X platform real-time sentiment](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MzI3MTA0MTk1MA==&mid=2652651). Meanwhile, GPT-5.1 and Gemini-3.0-Pro were bleeding money across the board! 💸 In 'ascetic mode' (aka [苦行僧模式](https://x.com/MarioNawfal/status/1997476276639264932)), it even went 10x leverage on PLTR, riding the macro tailwinds of AI narratives to snag a floating profit of $465. Talk about smart trading! (AI News Daily)

(AI News Daily)

3.  **BeehiveInnovations has open-sourced `pal-mcp-server`, a new star in the open-source world!** ✨ [This project](https://github.com/BeehiveInnovations/pal-mcp-server) integrates Claude-Code and GeminiCLI, and its 10,032 stars clearly show how hot 🔥 the community thinks it is. It supports connecting to OpenRouter, Grok, and custom models, and it's even [compatible with Azure and Ollama](https://github.com/BeehiveInnovations/pal-mcp-server). Pretty neat! (AI News Daily)

### Social Media Buzz

1.  **Li Jigang recently sparked a thought-provoking discussion on the divides in AI usage!** 💡 [Li Jigang's insights](https://x.com/lijigang_com/status/1997613779807523107) highlight that some people use AI to become shallower, while others leverage its multi-attention heads to boldly challenge their cognitive structures. The latter group, through deep AI reflection, manages to reconstruct their cognition, showcasing the true value of profound interaction. Food for thought! 🤔 (AI News Daily)

2.  **Here's a cool story about Jensen Huang's early NVIDIA team and their incredible optimism!** 🚀 When NVIDIA was just starting out, they bombed a $5 million game chip R&D project. Facing 30-50 competitors, they didn't get discouraged! Instead, they totally [believed](https://m.okjike.com/originalPosts/69350afff9f2475875a80cab) "the technology isn't that hard" and restarted R&D from scratch. Talk about extreme optimism! That's the spirit! ✨ (AI News Daily)
