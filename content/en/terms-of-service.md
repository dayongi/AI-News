# Terms of Service

*Effective Date: June 1, 2025*

---

Hey there! 👋 Welcome to **ai.hubtoday** (we'll call it "the Site" or "us" from now on). Before you dive into our services, please take a moment to read these Terms of Service. By hitting up our site or using our services, you're totally agreeing to these terms.

## 1. About Our Services
The Site offers users a sweet array of paid subscription content and membership services. Think blog posts, exclusive resources, e-books, and lively community interactions – the whole shebang! Just a heads-up, some content is only available to our awesome subscribers.

## 2. User Registration & Your Account
- To get your account set up, you'll need to drop us a valid email address and pick a password.
- Your account is totally your responsibility – that means keeping it secure and owning all the activities under its name. Seriously, **don't** transfer or share your account, okay? 🙅‍♀️
- If you ever play outside the lines and violate these terms, we reserve the right to **suspend or terminate** your account. Just sayin'.

## 3. Paid Subscription Services
- Our subscription services are billed monthly or annually, and you'll see all the deets about the costs clearly laid out on the checkout page.
- Heads up: all payments roll through third-party payment platforms like Stripe or PayPal. We don't stash any of your payment info on our end, so you're all good. 💳
- Your subscription will **automatically renew**, so keep that in mind! If you want to stop the auto-renew, just make sure to cancel before your current billing cycle wraps up.
- **14-Day Refund Policy**: If this is your very first time subscribing and you're not totally stoked with our service, you can snag a full refund within 14 days of your purchase. Just hit us up at the contact email listed at the end of these terms and let us know why you're bouncing. Each user gets one shot at this refund, cool? After 14 days, or if you're not a first-time subscriber, no refunds will be issued post-payment, unless the law literally makes us. Sorry, not sorry! 😉

## 4. Content Usage & Intellectual Property
- All our original content is **copyrighted by the Site (hubtoday)**. That means no copying, reprinting, or using it for commercial purposes without our express permission. Got it? 🛡️
- You, the user, get a **non-exclusive, non-transferable access right** to this content. It's all for your personal learning and reading enjoyment.
- If you're looking to use our stuff for commercial purposes or need to quote a whole lot, please, please, **please reach out to us for authorization first**.

## 5. User Conduct Guidelines
- Just to be super clear, **don't** upload, post, or spread any content that's illegal, harassing, false, offensive, or infringes on anyone else's rights. That's a big no-no. ⛔
- And seriously, **don't** try to bulk download, scrape, or hack into our member content using any technical trickery. We'll find out! 🕵️‍♀️
- If you break these rules, we've got the right to yank down any inappropriate content and **ban offending users**. Poof!

## 6. Service Changes & Interruptions
- We reserve the right to change, pause, or totally terminate any part or all of our services whenever we want, without giving you a heads-up. That's just how it rolls.
- If things go sideways due to stuff like force majeure, server meltdowns, or third-party service hiccups, making our content temporarily unavailable, the Site **won't be on the hook for any compensation**. Bummer, we know, but it happens.

## 7. Disclaimer
- The info we dish out on this Site is purely for your reference, and it definitely **doesn't count** as any kind of professional advice (like financial, legal, or medical stuff). Just so we're clear. 💡
- The Site **isn't responsible** for any direct or indirect losses you might rack up from using our content or services. Fair warning!

## 8. Governing Law
- These Terms of Service are governed by and interpreted under the laws of California, USA, without regard to any conflict of law principles. So, California law is the boss here. ⚖️
- If any disputes pop up because of these terms or are related to them, we should both try to sort it out amicably first. If we can't hug it out, you agree to take the matter to the courts in Santa Clara County, California, which have jurisdiction.
