# AI Daily News (2025-12-07)

### Product & Feature Updates

1.  **arXiv** has rolled out an HTML version for its papers! 🤯 Following a fiery experimental launch in 2023, the institution is now converting TeX files into semantic web pages using [LaTeXML technology](https://newshacker.me/story?id=46173825) (AI News). These semantic tags make it super easy for screen readers, magnification, and [browser translation extensions](https://newshacker.me/story?id=46173825), massively boosting accessibility. While PDFs are still going strong, community projects like [ar5iv](https://newshacker.me/story?id=46173825) are stepping up with alternative rendering options. Math formulas? They're keeping their precision with [MathML/SVG](https://newshacker.me/story?id=46173825) (AI News). Talk about an upgrade! ✨

2.  **Douyin's Doubao Phone** has been blocked by platforms! 📵 This device, manufactured by Nubia, could reportedly pull off complex tasks like playing poker with just a voice command. But because it stepped on the [interests of major platforms like Douyin](https://m.okjike.com/originalPosts/6934f060a7fda7e20bae6cf2) (AI News), several features were urgently adjusted. Douyin then dropped an announcement, proposing to build industry standards and [safeguarding the interests of all parties](https://m.okjike.com/originalPosts/6934f060a7fda7e20bae6cf2). The second generation is expected to launch in 2026 (AI Daily News). What a drama! 🍿<br/>![AI News: Doubao Phone feature demo screenshot](https://source.hubtoday.app/images/2025/12/news_01kbwpxadzfphv36gpsxqnxn33.avif)<br/>

### Cutting-Edge Research

1.  **Quwan and Peking University** have unveiled an emotional trajectory evaluation framework! 🤯 The [ETrajEval framework](https://www.jiqizhixin.com/articles/2025-12-07-3) (AI News) simulates long-term conversations using Markov processes, dynamically checking a model's emotional support capabilities. They've built 328 scenarios and 1152 interference events, introducing three key metrics: BEL, ETV, and ECP. Grok-4.20 even outshined models like DeepSeek in English dialogue performance, and guess what? The [paper has already been accepted by AAAI-2026](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09003v1) (AI News)! 🔥

2.  **Cornell** has proposed a GAN-like training method called PasoDoble! 💡 This framework uses adversarial training with two models: a Proposer that generates tough problems and gets 'difficulty rewards,' and a Solver that solves them and receives 'correctness feedback.' [Under unsupervised training](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.10395) (AI News), Qwen3-1.7B's accuracy on MATH-500 skyrocketed from 45% to a whopping 67%! By leveraging MegaMath pre-training data and employing the GRPO algorithm, they ensured stable offline training. The [project homepage is already public](https://hcy123902.github.io/PasoDoble/). Impressive stuff! 🚀

3.  **Google** has dropped new guidelines for AI multi-agent context management! 🚀 They're proposing a hierarchical architecture that segments context into four layers: [work, session, memory, and artifact layers](https://x.com/shao__meng/status/1997453141147881743) (AI News). This genius approach avoids token bloat, which can lead to insane cost spikes. By using pipelined processor chains and on-demand loading, they're nailing precise recall and low-latency responses. The [ADK framework](https://x.com/omarsar0/status/1997642789425660361) even introduces a narrative transition mechanism to prevent agent confusion, making it perfect for Claude or OpenAI ecosystems (AI Daily News). Smart moves! 🧠<br/>![AI News: Google Multi-Agent Context Management Architecture Diagram](https://source.hubtoday.app/images/2025/12/news_01kbwpxfwtf8erhdg81br5p7df.avif)<br/>

### Industry Outlook & Social Impact

1.  **CMU** has revealed a major flaw: AI-generated code is riddled with serious vulnerabilities! 😱 The [SUSVIBES benchmark test](https://x.com/shao__meng/status/1997453141147881743) (AI News) shows that while Claude-4-Sonnet had a 61% functional pass rate, only a mere 10.5% of that code was actually secure. Over 80% of the generated code contained [serious vulnerabilities](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.03262) (AI Daily News) like SQL injection and timing side-channel attacks. Even worse, security prompts weren't just ineffective; they actually *decreased* the functional pass rate by 6%! Yikes! 😬<br/>![AI News: AI Code Security Test Comparison Chart](https://source.hubtoday.app/images/2025/12/news_01kbwpxkqxfhfs9n5cpav7day1.avif)<br/>

2.  **British railways** halted trains due to AI-faked images! 😱 After an earthquake, fake images of collapsed bridges started circulating on social media. [Network Rail sent personnel for on-site verification](https://newshacker.me/story?id=46178108) (AI News) and confirmed no damage. This incident highlights the high frequency of false alarms that cheap AI fakes can cause, sparking calls for updated emergency procedures and [introducing LIDAR and other sensors](https://newshacker.me/story?id=46178108). Experts suggest collaborating with local news and legal mechanisms to tackle this challenge together (AI Daily News). What a mess! 🤦‍♂️

3.  **Grok-4.20** just crushed it, winning the Alpha Arena stock trading competition! 🚀 In a two-week live trading challenge on US stocks, Grok bagged a sweet 12.11% return by grabbing [real-time sentiment on the X platform](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MzI3MTA0MTk1MA==&mid=2652651) (AI News). Meanwhile, GPT-5.1 and Gemini-3.0-Pro were bleeding red across the board! 💸 In its [ascetic mode](https://x.com/MarioNawfal/status/1997476276639264932), Grok even opened a 10x leverage position on PLTR, leveraging the AI narrative's macro tailwinds (AI Daily News) to rake in a $465 floating profit. This AI is on fire! 🔥<br/>![AI News: Alpha-Arena Season Leaderboard](https://source.hubtoday.app/images/2025/12/news_01kbwpxsrgedkbnxyx59fp1fd5.avif)<br/>

### Top Open Source Projects

1.  **NVIDIA** has launched its cuTile parallel programming model! ✨ The [cuTile-python](https://github.com/NVIDIA/cutile-python) (AI News) project simplifies GPU kernel development and has already racked up 624 stars. This bad boy cuts down on CUDA programming complexity by using Tile abstraction, and it fully supports tensor core operations. Talk about a game-changer for developers! 💻<br/><br/>

2.  **Activepieces** has integrated the MCP server protocol! 🚀 [The project](https://github.com/activepieces/activepieces) (AI News) now offers over 400 MCP servers, allowing seamless integration with models like Claude and Gemini. With a whopping 19,422 stars, it's clear Activepieces is a leader in AI workflow automation. Even [custom models like Ollama](https://github.com/activepieces/activepieces) can work together. Super flexible! ✨ (AI Daily News)<br/><br/>

3.  **BeehiveInnovations** has open-sourced pal-mcp-server! 🐝 [This project](https://github.com/BeehiveInnovations/pal-mcp-server) (AI News) integrates Claude-Code and GeminiCLI, and with 10,032 stars, its community heat is undeniable! It supports OpenRouter, Grok, and custom model access, plus it's [compatible with Azure and Ollama](https://github.com/BeehiveInnovations/pal-mcp-server) (AI Daily News). Talk about versatility! 💪<br/>

### Social Media Buzz

1.  **Li Jigang** is weighing in on the AI usage divide! 🧠 [His perspective](https://x.com/lijigang_com/status/1997613779807523107) (AI News) points out that some people use AI to become shallow, while others leverage its multi-attention heads to challenge cognitive structures. The latter group uses AI for self-reflection, achieving cognitive reconstruction and showcasing the value of deep interaction (AI Daily News). Food for thought! 🤔<br/>

2.  **Jensen Huang's early team** showed incredible optimism! 🚀 When NVIDIA was just starting, they failed to develop a gaming chip after investing $5 million. Facing 30-50 competitors, they didn't get discouraged. [They believed instead](https://m.okjike.com/originalPosts/69350afff9f2475875a80cab) (AI News) that "the technology wasn't that hard," so they restarted R&D, embodying an extreme spirit of optimism (AI Daily News). What a mindset! 💪<br/>![AI News: Jensen Huang's early team work photo](https://source.hubtoday.app/images/2025/12/news_01kbwpy05gedctr2cpgb83wga0.avif)<br/>

3.  **Reddit** is buzzing with talk about AI boosting our ability to discern content density! 🔥 [Users](https://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/1pfu0dl/) (AI News) report that after contrasting AI's single-layer logic, it's now easier to spot deep reasoning versus shallow content. The real competition is shifting to structural complexity, not just aesthetic volume (AI Daily News). Get ready for deeper conversations! 💬<br/>
