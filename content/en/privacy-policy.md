*Last updated: June 1, 2025*

---

This Privacy Policy lays out our policy and procedures for collecting, using, and dishing out your info when you're using our service. It also spills the tea on your privacy rights and how the law's got your back.

We totally use your personal data to power up and fine-tune our service. By hopping on board and using the service, you're basically giving us the green light to collect and use your info according to this Privacy Policy. 😉

## Explanations and Definitions

### Explanations
Capitalized words? They've got meanings defined under these specific conditions. And guess what? These definitions totally mean the same thing, whether they show up as singular or plural. Easy peasy!

### Definitions
For the lowdown on this Privacy Policy, here's what we mean:

- **Account** means the unique account we set up for you to get into our service or parts of it. 🔐

- **Affiliate** is basically an entity that controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with another party. And when we say "control," we're talking about owning 50% or more of the shares, equity interest, or other securities that have voting power for directors or other big-shot management folks. Got it?

- **Company** (referred to as "the Company," "We," or "Our" in this Agreement, by the way) means **hubtoday**. That's us! 🚀

- **Cookies** are these tiny files that websites pop onto your computer, mobile device, or any other gadget. They stash all sorts of deets, like your browsing history on that site, for a bunch of different uses. 🍪

- **Country** points to California, USA. 🇺🇸

- **Device** means any gadget that can tap into the Service, like a computer, a phone, or a digital tablet. 📱

- **Personal Data** is any info that's connected to an identified or identifiable individual. Pretty straightforward, right?

- **Service** refers to this Website. Duh! 😉

- **Service Provider** means any natural or legal person who crunches data on behalf of the Company. This could be a third-party company or individual the Company hires to help deliver the Service, provide the Service for us, handle Service-related tasks, or even help us analyze how the Service is being used. They're our trusty sidekicks! 💪

- **Usage Data** is that info we automatically collect, generated either by you using the Service or from the Service infrastructure itself (think: how long you hang out on a page).

- **Website** means **hubtoday**, which you can find chilling at `https://ai.hubtoday.app/`. Check us out! 👀

- **You** refers to the individual who's checking out or using the Service, or the company or other legal entity that individual is representing when accessing or using the Service. So, basically, you! 😜

## Collecting and Using Your Personal Data

### Types of Data We Collect

#### Personal Data
When you're using our Service, we might ask you to hand over some personally identifiable info that we can use to get in touch with you or figure out who you are. This PII (that's Personally Identifiable Information, for short) could include, but isn't limited to:

- Email address 📧
- Usage Data

#### Usage Data
Usage Data? Yeah, that stuff gets collected automatically when you're rocking our Service.

Usage Data might include your device's Internet Protocol address (like your IP address), what kind of browser you're using, its version, the pages you hit up on our Service, when and what time you visited, how long you hung out on those pages, unique device identifiers, and other diagnostic data. It's all about how you interact!

When you're tapping into the Service from your mobile device, we might automatically grab some info. This includes, but isn't limited to, the type of mobile device you're using, its unique ID, your mobile device's IP address, your mobile operating system, the type of mobile internet browser you're rocking, unique device identifiers, and other diagnostic data. We like to know what gear you're packing! 📱

When you hit up our Service, whether it's on a desktop or your mobile, we might also collect the info your browser sends our way.

### Tracking Technologies and Cookies
We totally use Cookies and similar tracking tech to keep an eye on activity on our Service and stash away certain info. The tracking technologies we roll with include beacons, tags, and scripts, all designed to collect and track info, plus improve and analyze our Service. The tech we might use includes:

- **Cookies or Browser Cookies**: A Cookie is a small file dropped onto your Device. You can totally tell your browser to refuse all Cookies or to give you a heads-up when a Cookie is being sent. But heads up: if you don't accept Cookies, you might not be able to use certain awesome parts of our Service. Unless you've tweaked your browser settings to say "no thanks" to Cookies, our Service might just use 'em anyway. 🍪
- **Web Beacons**: Some parts of our Service and even our emails might have these tiny electronic files called web beacons (you might also hear them called clear gifs, pixel tags, or single-pixel gifs). These little guys let the Company (for example) count users who've visited those pages or opened an email, and they're used for other cool website stats (like seeing how popular a certain section is and making sure our systems and servers are all good).

Cookies can be either "Persistent" or "Session" Cookies. Persistent Cookies chill on your personal computer or mobile device even after you go offline, while Session Cookies vanish into thin air the second you close your web browser. Poof! 💨

We use both Session and Persistent Cookies for the following reasons:

- **Necessary / Essential Cookies**
  - **Type**: Session Cookies
  - **Administered by**: Us
  - **Purpose**: These Cookies are absolutely crucial for hooking you up with services available through the Website and letting you use some of its cool features. They're super helpful for authenticating users and preventing shady, fraudulent use of user accounts. No joke, without these Cookies, the services you've asked for simply wouldn't work, and we only use 'em to bring you those specific services. 🔒

- **Cookies Policy / Notice Acceptance Cookies**
  - **Type**: Persistent Cookies
  - **Administered by**: Us
  - **Purpose**: These Cookies are all about checking if users have given the thumbs-up to using cookies on the Website. Simple as that! 👍

- **Functionality Cookies**
  - **Type**: Persistent Cookies
  - **Administered by**: Us
  - **Purpose**: These Cookies are pretty neat because they let us remember your choices when you're using the Website, like keeping your login info handy or recalling your language preference. The whole point of these Cookies is to give you a more personalized experience and save you the hassle of re-entering your preferences every single time you hit up the Website. So convenient! ✨

For the full scoop on the Cookies we use and your options regarding them, just swing by our Cookies Policy or the Cookies section of our Privacy Policy.

### How We Use Your Personal Data
The Company might just use your Personal Data for the following reasons:

- **To provide and maintain our Service**, including keeping an eye on how our Service is being used. We gotta keep things running smoothly! 🛠️
- **To manage Your Account**: This means handling your registration as a Service user. The Personal Data you hand over lets you access all the cool, different features available to you as a registered user. So, get registered and unlock those perks! 🔓
- **For the performance of a contract**: This involves cooking up, sticking to, and delivering on the purchase contract for any products, items, or services you've bought, or any other contract you've got going on with us through the Service. We're all about keeping our promises! 🤝
- **To contact You**: We might reach out to you via email, phone calls, SMS, or other similar electronic communication methods (like push notifications from a mobile app, for example). This is to give you updates or informational comms related to features, products, or contracted services, including security updates, whenever it's necessary or makes sense. We'll keep you in the loop! 🔔
- **To provide You with news**, sweet special offers, and general info about other goods, services, and events we offer. This stuff will be similar to what you've already bought or asked about, unless you've decided to opt out of getting such info. Don't miss out! 🤩
- **To manage Your requests**: Pretty simple – we handle and manage any requests you send our way. We're here to help! 👋
- **For business transfers**: We might use your info to scope out or pull off a merger, divestiture, restructuring, reorganization, dissolution, or any other sale or transfer of some or all of our assets. This could be as a going concern or as part of a bankruptcy, liquidation, or similar proceeding, where the Personal Data we hold about our Service users is one of the assets being transferred. Big changes! 💼
- **For other purposes**: We might use your info for other cool stuff, like data analysis, spotting usage trends, figuring out how effective our promotional campaigns are, and generally evaluating and boosting our Service, products, marketing, and your overall experience. Always trying to get better! ✨

We might share your personal information in these situations:

- **With Service Providers**: We might share your Personal Information with Service Providers to monitor and analyze how our Service is being used, and to get in touch with you. Teamwork makes the dream work! 🤝
- **For business transfers**: We might share or transfer your Personal Information during, or in anticipation of, any merger, sale of Company assets, financing, or acquisition of all or a portion of our business by another company. It's all part of the game! 🎢
- **With Affiliates**: We might share your info with our Affiliates, and when we do, we'll totally make sure those Affiliates play by the rules of this Privacy Policy. Affiliates include our parent company and any other subsidiaries, joint venture partners, or other companies that we control or that are under common control with us. It's a family affair! 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦
- **With business partners**: We might share your info with our business partners to hook you up with certain products, services, or rad promotions. Sharing is caring! ✨
- **With other users**: When you swap Personal Information or interact with other users in public areas, that info might be seen by everyone and could even be out there publicly. So, think before you share! 🌎
- **With Your consent**: If you give us the A-OK, we might totally spill your Personal Information for any other purpose. You call the shots! 🎯

### Retention of Your Personal Data
The Company will only hang onto your Personal Data for as long as it's necessary for the purposes we've laid out in this Privacy Policy. We'll keep and use your Personal Data to the extent needed to follow our legal obligations (like if we gotta keep your data to comply with applicable laws), sort out disputes, and enforce our legal agreements and policies. We play by the rules! ⚖️

The Company will also keep Usage Data for internal analysis. Usage Data usually sticks around for a shorter period, unless that data is used to beef up the security or pump up the functionality of our Service, or if we're legally bound to hold onto it for a longer time. Security first! 🔒

### Transfer of Your Personal Data
Your info (yeah, that includes Personal Data!) gets processed at the Company's operating offices and any other spots where the parties involved in the processing are located. This means your info could be zipped over to and stored on computers located outside of your state, province, country, or other governmental jurisdiction where the data protection laws might be a bit different from your neck of the woods. Just a heads-up! 🗺️

By giving the nod to this Privacy Policy and submitting your info, you're totally agreeing to that transfer. No surprises here!

The Company will take all reasonably necessary steps to make sure your data is handled securely and in line with this Privacy Policy. We won't transfer your Personal Data to any organization or country unless there are solid controls in place, including top-notch security for your data and other personal info. Your safety is our priority! ✅

### Deleting Your Personal Data
You totally have the right to delete your Personal Data that we've collected, or ask us to lend a hand in deleting it. It's your data, your call! 🗑️

Our Service might even let you scrub some info about yourself right from within the Service itself. Pretty handy, right?

You can totally update, modify, or delete your info anytime by logging into your account (if you've got one) and heading over to the account settings section that lets you manage your personal info. Or, if you prefer, you can just hit us up to ask for access, correction, or deletion of any Personal Information you've given us. We're here to help you manage your digital life! 🧑‍💻

But do note: sometimes we might need to hang onto certain info if we have a legal obligation or a legit reason to do so. Just keeping it real! 📜

### Disclosure of Your Personal Data

#### Business Transactions
If the Company gets tangled up in a merger, acquisition, or asset sale, your Personal Data might get transferred. We'll make sure to give you a heads-up before your Personal Data gets moved and becomes subject to a whole different privacy policy. Stay informed! 📣

#### Law Enforcement
In certain situations, the Company might have to spill your Personal Data if the law demands it or if there's a valid request from public authorities (like a court or government agency). We gotta comply! 👮

#### Other Legal Requirements
The Company might totally spill your Personal Data if we genuinely believe that such action is necessary to:
- Fulfill a legal obligation
- Protect and defend the rights or property of the Company
- Prevent or investigate possible wrongdoing in connection with the Service
- Protect the personal safety of Service users or the public
- Protect against legal liability

### Security of Your Personal Data
The security of Your Personal Data is a big deal to us, but keep this in mind: no method of transmission over the Internet or electronic storage is ever 100% rock-solid secure. While we totally bust our chops to use commercially acceptable ways to protect your Personal Data, we just can't guarantee its absolute security. We do our best, though! 🔒💪

## Children's Privacy
Our Service isn't aimed at anyone under the age of 13. Nope! We don't knowingly scoop up personally identifiable info from anyone under 13. If you're a parent or guardian and you know your kiddo has handed over Personal Data to us, please hit us up. If we find out we've collected Personal Data from anyone under 13 without verifiable parental consent, we'll take steps to delete that info from our servers. Kids' privacy is serious business! 🚫👶

If we need to lean on consent as the legal basis for processing your info, and your country totally requires parental consent, we might just ask for your parent's permission before we collect and use that info. Better safe than sorry! 🙏

## Links to Other Websites
Our Service might have links that lead to other websites that we don't operate. If you click on a third-party link, you'll be whisked away to that third party's site. We seriously recommend you check out the Privacy Policy of every single site you visit. Stay safe out there! 🔗👀

We have zero control over the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party websites or services, and we can't take any responsibility for them. Just putting it out there! 🤷‍♀️

## Changes to This Privacy Policy
We might totally update our Privacy Policy from time to time. When we do, we'll let you know about any changes by dropping the new Privacy Policy right here on this page. Easy peasy!

Before the changes officially kick in, we'll give you a heads-up via email and/or a prominent notice on our Service, and we'll update the "Last updated" date at the very top of this Privacy Policy. You'll be in the know! 🗓️✨

You're advised to regularly check out this Privacy Policy for any changes. Any tweaks to this Privacy Policy become effective the moment they're posted on this page. So, keep an eye out! 🤓
